/**
 * Challenges with Callback Implementation
 *
 * This file addresses common misconceptions about callback (alternative) JavaScript patterns
 * and their limitations.
 *
 * Key points:
 *
 * 1. Callback Hell
 *    - Often cited as the main problem with callbacks
 *    - Refers to deeply nested callback functions creating "pyramid of doom"
 *    - While visually problematic, this is NOT the biggest issue with callbacks
 *
 * 2. The Real Problem: Inversion of Control
 *    - When using callbacks, you hand control of your program flow to another function
 *    - You trust that the callback will be:
 *      * Called the correct number of times (once, not zero or multiple times)
 *      * Called with proper parameters
 *      * Called at the right time
 *      * Properly handling errors
 *    - Loss of control creates potential for bugs that are hard to trace
 *
 * 3. Alternative Patterns and Their Limitations
 *    - Promises help with callback hell through chaining
 *      * But can create "Promise hell" with complex logic
 *    - Async/await improves readability
 *      * But can still create "async/await hell" in complex scenarios
 *
 * The evolution of these patterns (callbacks → promises → async/await)
 * primarily addresses readability concerns, but each approach still has
 * cases where code organization becomes unwieldy.
 *
 * Ultimately, the most important improvements in newer patterns relate to:
 * - Readability of asynchronous code
 * - Regaining control over program flow
 * - Standardized error handling mechanisms
