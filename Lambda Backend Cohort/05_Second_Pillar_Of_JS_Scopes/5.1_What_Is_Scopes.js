// One of the most important features - Scopes
// Scope = field of view (represents visibility)

// when we mention visibility - we target and associate for variables, functions ..
// Scopes help us understand where to look for and where the specific items are visible

// To understand scope we need to know that everything inside your code, will be used in one of the following 2 ways
// 1. either it will be getting some value assigned to it (or)
// 2. or some value will be returned from it
