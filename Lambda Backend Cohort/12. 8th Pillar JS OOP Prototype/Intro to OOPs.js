Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Goal: Create blueprints (classes) for objects that share:
- Properties (data members)
  - name 
  - price
  - description 
  - category
  
- Behaviors (methods)
  - buy()
  - sell() 
  - wishlist()

Key Concepts:
1. Class: Blueprint for creating objects
2. Object: Instance of a class
3. Properties: Unique data that identifies an object
4. Methods: Common behaviors shared across objects
