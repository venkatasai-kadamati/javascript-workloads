/**
 * JavaScript Arrays as Objects
 *
 * Arrays in JavaScript are specialized objects where:
 * - typeof [1, 2, 3] evaluates to 'object'
 * - Array indices serve as object keys
 * - Array elements become object values
 *
 * Example:
 * ['abc', 'def', 'ghi'] internally represents as:
 * { 0: "abc", 1: "def", 2: "ghi" }
 */

/**
 * Array.map() - Higher Order Function
 *
 * A common example of Higher Order Functions (HOFs) that:
 * - Takes a function as an argument
 * - Returns a new array where each element is transformed
 *   by applying the provided function
 *
 * HOFs are functions that either:
 * - Accept other functions as arguments
 * - Return functions as their output
